# Car-Rental-System
The Car Rental System is a Java-based application designed to streamline and automate the process of car rental management for both customers and administrators.​

# Car Rental System (Java GUI)

The **Car Rental System** is a Java-based application with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** designed to automate and simplify the process of renting cars for both customers and administrators. The system supports booking management, user authentication, and an efficient rental workflow integrated with a database backend.

## Concepts Implemented

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming
The project follows full OOP principles:
- **Inheritance** → (`User → Customer / Admin`, `Vehicle → Car`)
- **Polymorphism** → Dashboard UI and rental calculation overridden based on user type
- **Interfaces** → `CRUDOperations<T>` implemented by DAO classes
- **Exception Handling** → Custom exceptions for invalid inputs, login failure, and booking errors

### 🔹 Collections & Generics
- Data stored using `ArrayList<Car>`, `ArrayList<Booking>` etc.
- Generics used for type safety in DAO operations

### 🔹 Multithreading & Synchronization
- Background threads used for loading data from the database to keep the GUI responsive
- Synchronization implemented during booking to prevent double-booking of cars

### 🔹 Database Operations (DAO Classes)
Separate classes for database operations:
- `CarDAO`
- `CustomerDAO`
- `BookingDAO`

Each class handles CRUD operations using reusable methods.

### 🔹 JDBC Connectivity
- JDBC API used to connect Java GUI with the database
- `Connection`, `PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet` used for secure SQL communication
- SQL Injection prevented using parameterized queries
- `DBConnection.java` manages database connection handling
